> First robotics competition: Steamworks - Denmark

## First Robotics Competition
[FIRST Robotics Competition](https://www.firstinspires.org/robotics/frc) is an international robot competition, for students at the age of 14-18.

## Purpose
This project aims to cover the essential features for a general robot, like movement and basic sensors, up and running easy and fast. It is ment to be the base program to be built further upon.

The code can be used as an example, for other people or teams, participating in the First Robotics Competition.

### The future of this project
We will keep updating this repository for the next FRC competition (2018), and possibly even longer.
